### Pong AI Game 🏓🤖

A Python-based **Pong game** where a human player competes against an **AI opponent** that predicts ball trajectory. The AI only sees the game **once per second**, making strategic decisions based on ball physics.

## Features 🚀

- **Real-Time Pong Gameplay** – Classic Pong with enhanced physics.
- **AI Opponent with Ball** Trajectory Prediction – The AI calculates where the ball will land and moves accordingly.
- **Dynamic Ball Speed** – The ball's speed increases based on where it hits the paddle, making the game more unpredictable.
- **AI Vision Limitation** – The AI can only "see" the game state every 1 second, adding a unique challenge.
- **Configurable Settings** – Modify AI behavior, physics, and game parameters in config.py.
## Installation 🔧
**1. Install Python (If not installed)**

Check if Python is installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If not, install it using:
```bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
**2. Install Dependencies**

The game requires **pygame** and **numpy**. Install them using:
```bash

pip3 install pygame numpy
```
## Running the Game ▶️

Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash

python3 src/main.py
```
## How the AI Works 🧠

- The AI **only "sees" the game state every 1 second**.
- When it sees the ball, it predicts its trajectory and moves to the expected impact position.
- The AI **does not control the paddle** — it follows the same movement rules as a human player by stimulation keys **up** and **down**.
- The **ball speed changes dynamically** based on where it hits the paddle, making trajectory prediction harder.

## Game Controls 🎮

| Action | Player 1 |
| --- | --- |
| Move **Up**   | ARROW KEY UP `↑` |
| Move **Down** | ARROW KEY DOWN `↓` |
| Quit **Game** | `Esc` or Close Window |


The AI controls Player 2 automatically.
## Modifying Game Settings ⚙️

Customize the game in ``src/config.py``:

- AI vision frequency (AI_WAIT = 1) – Adjust AI wait time in seconds.
- Ball speed modifiers – Modify the initial speed of the ball.
- Screen size, paddle speed, and other game physics.
